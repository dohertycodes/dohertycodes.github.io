# MEMBER PAGE GUIDELINES - IMPORTANT

<br>

## Want to create your own member page? Great! Here's what you should do:

<ol>

<li>Copy the firstname-lastname folder to pages>members</li>
<li>Change all instances of firstname-lastname (and similar, such as firstname lastname) to your first name and last name, *including* within HTML files</li>
<li>Be sure to follow the instructions in the template HTML file</li>
<li>
Experiment! Feel free to use your own CSS, JS, assets, etc., with a few *important* rules:

<ul>
<li>Any video clips on your page and hosted *on this site* may **NOT** exceed 15s, and you may **NOT** have more than five (you can host them somewhere else and link them!)</li>
<li>Your page is only accessible from the Members page of the main site - don't include navigation to other parts of the site (unless you make your own subpages)</li>
<li>Don't cause interference with other parts of the site (i.e., intentionally-broken nav links)</li>
</ul>

Why these rules? We want the site to be as easy to navigate as possible - on top of this, GitHub pages has a size limit, which is why we have the video rule!
